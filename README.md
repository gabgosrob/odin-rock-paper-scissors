# Odin Rock Paper Scissors

HTML/CSS/JS web project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Skills Learned

### JavaScript
This project allowed me to practice implementing logic into a webpage with JavaScript. I am now very comfortable with its syntax (variables, loops, conditionals, functions etc..).

### DOM
I also learned what the DOM is, how it's implemented in modern browsers and how to manipulate it using query functions in JavaScript.
